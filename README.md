So, this is the alpha version of Bob's Epic Adventure!

As I upload, I'll keep the previous versions attached for a record (even though they have designated pages).

So, What have I done in this version?

- Completed level 3.
- Added enemies
- Started creation on level 4 (final level).
- Changed textures of levels so that they are different and there is variety.
- Fixed formatting for timer record and coin count (the pages between levels).
