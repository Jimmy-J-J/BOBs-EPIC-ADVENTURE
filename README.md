This is Bob's Epic Adventure.
It is a 2D platformer that I am working on for an assessment.

The criteria was that I had to create a game for children, which is why Bob looks so good.

A colleague in my class said this game would fail me, but I think not.
I have faith in Bob, and I think this will turn out to be a masterpiece.

Feedback would be appreciated, and I will probably upload a few versions before I have to submit it.
Who knows, I might even expand on it outside of school. 

P.S. Below is a picture of Bob (he's very cool)
