This is the beta version of Bob's Epic Adventure!

I have not put this as the final version because I am planning to add something else when I don't have school to attend to.

What has been added?
- Now in the taskbar and file explorer on windows has got an icon that is not the Godot logo.
- All levels are completed
- Game runs in fullscreen (no taskbar)
- To get out of fullscreen, there is a quit game button on pause menu when you press esc.
